# Forb ( WIP )

## Forb is a conditional form builder. ( reactjs)

Recently I read [this article](https://www.aaron-powell.com/posts/2020-12-10-dynamic-forms-with-react-hooks/) and decided to develop it as a full project and called it Forb.

In my experience and in the large projects it is better to make or use some generators instead of coding and managing many components, for example:
- JSON based form generator
- Just one dialog with dynamic component loading inside 
- JSON based table generator

The main purpose of Forb is the generator part but Forb has tow parts: Form Generator and Form Builder and at this moment I don't have any plan to release it as a product but I'm not sure about the future.

I'm working and hope to deploy the Form Generator as soon as possible.
